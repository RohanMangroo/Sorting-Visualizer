This is a Sorting Visualizer

This is a polished version of my async week project I did during my time at FullStack Academy

It's a completly Front End project using React/Redux/JavaScript/CSS

If you'd like to try it out locally, simply clone down and 'npm run start'

I will be updating it as the months go on but for now it's done and I'll be working on new projects

It's best used on desktop as I haven't learned much responsive design yet

If you'd like to run this locally, remember to remove "homepage":"http://RohanMangroo.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer" from package.json
This key value is used to deploy to GitHub pages but breaks the CSS in local dev. Need to figure out the solution...
