This is a Sorting Visualizer

This is a polished version of my async week project I did during my time at FullStack Academy

It's a completly Front End project using React/Redux/JavaScript/CSS

If you'd like to try it out locally, simply clone down and 'npm run start'

I will be updating it as the months go on but for now it's done and I'll be working on new projects

It's best used on desktop as I haven't learned much responsive design yet
